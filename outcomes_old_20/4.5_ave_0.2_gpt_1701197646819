GPT Answered: 
at least 2, depending on how many arrays are being used. - Incorrect
all of them. - Incorrect
When passing a multi-dimensional array, all dimensions must be specified except for the first dimension. - Correct
It depends what parameters you are passing in a multidimensional.  A multideminsional can have more than two dimensions. - Incorrect
The first dimension is not required however the subsequent dimension(s) are needed for the compiler. - Correct
just the first one at least. - Incorrect
The size of the first dimension can be omitted, same as a regular array. However, for every dimension outside the first, the size of those dimensions must be specified when passed, for example, a multi-dimensional array of [2][4][6] with the name MultiArray would be passed as: "MultiArray[][4][6], 2" - Correct
Size of subsequent dimensions are required. Compiler must know how many elements to skip to move to the second element in the first dimension - Correct
Every dimension after the first. - Correct
both - Incorrect
the size of the first dimension does not need to be specified, but all other dimensions do. - Correct
when passing (in main) a multidimensional array to a function, no dimensions need be specified - Incorrect
All dimensions except for the first one need to be specified when passing an array to a function, the compiler needs to know how many memory addresses to skip to make it back to the 2nd element in the first dimension.  The size of the first dimension does not need to be specified. - Correct
as many as there are dimensions. Most commonly just rows and columns - Incorrect
at least 2, but it should always equal the number of dimensions that the argument is expecting... like... blah[][][][] will require 4 dimensional array input.blah[][][] will require a 3 dimensional array.blah[][] will require a 2 dimensional array. - Incorrect
all subsequent dimensions after the first dimension.  first is not needed to be specified. - Correct
all dimensions but the first - Correct
the first needs to be specified by size and the rest need only be stated( first like this [3] then [][][][]) - Incorrect
one less than the number of dimensions the array contains - Correct
not answered - Incorrect
one - Incorrect
two or more - Incorrect
1 less than the total number of dimensions - Correct
Multi dimensional arrays are accessed using more than 1  index, one for each dimension at least. - Incorrect
