printing a tree in order from least to greatest. This done by going as far left down the tree as possible and printing the parent and then right tree. Then move up the tree. - Correct

Inorder traversal of a binary tree will retrieve start at the furthest left hand leaf and checks it, itâ€™s parent, and itâ€™s right side sibling, then it goes up a level and repeats until it gets to the root. - Correct
